# Rust Matrix Operations Library

## Overview
This is a Rust-based Matrix Operations Library that provides fundamental linear algebra functionalities such as matrix addition, multiplication, transposition, and determinant calculation. This project is ideal for learning Rust while working with mathematical concepts.

## Features
- **Matrix Creation** - Initialize matrices with custom dimensions and data.
- **Zero Matrix** - Generate an empty matrix filled with zeros.
- **Matrix Addition** - Add two matrices element-wise.
- **Matrix Multiplication** - Perform matrix multiplication.
- **Matrix Transposition** - Transpose a given matrix.
- **Determinant Calculation** - Compute the determinant of a square matrix.
- **Error Handling** - Ensures operations follow valid matrix rules.

## Installation
Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it using:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
